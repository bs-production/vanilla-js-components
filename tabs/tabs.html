<h2>Crawl Space Waterproofing Solutions</h2>
<a class="lightbox mag right" title="Our crawl space sump pump system is provided with an optional battery backup sump pump, which can pump more than 12,000 gallons on a single full charge." href="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/crawl-space-waterproofing-lg.jpg"><img class="border" src="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/crawl-space-waterproofing-thm.jpg" alt="a crawl space sump pump system" width="250px" height="250px;" /></a>
<p>Flooding in a crawl space can lead to a variety of issues, including mold, moisture, and ruined fiberglass insulation. Before the crawl space can be dried or upgrades are made to the space, it's extremely important that all sources of standing water are addressed.</p>
<p>Your local CleanSpace&reg; dealer has access to a variety of drainage and water removal solutions for your crawl space, including sump pump systems, drain systems, drainage matting, and our custom-designed crawl space perimeter drain system.</p>
<p>If your crawl space floods due to a plumbing failure, a homeowner can go weeks, months, or even years before the leak is discovered. Our system includes a water alarm system, so you know right away.</p>

<h2>Crawl Space Insulation</h2>
<a class="lightbox mag right border" title="TerraBlock&trade; insulation is designed to work with uneven and/or dirt floors, installed underneath a light-duty crawl space liner.  It will not be damaged by flooding, and it does not support the growth of mold, rot, or mildew." href="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/insulated-crawl-space-lg.jpg"><img src="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/insulated-crawl-space-thm.jpg" alt="a crawl space with insulated walls and floors" width="250px" height="250px;" /></a>
<p>Fiberglass insulation installed between the floor joists in a crawl space is notorious for becoming weighed down with humidity and moisture. As it does, it will sag downwards, eventually falling uselessly to the ground.</p>
<p>CleanSpace&reg; Dealers have exclusive access to our SilverGlo&trade; Crawl Space Insulation System -- an innovative, waterproof insulation and radiant heat barrier.</p>
<p>When installed on your crawl space walls, SilverGlo&trade; doubles as a vapor barrier, protecting your crawl space from moisture and humidity from the walls.</p>
<p>For your crawl space floor, we recommend the TerraBlock&trade; Crawl Space Floor Insulation &amp; Vapor Barrier System -- which is rugged enough to withstand foot traffic without damage!</p>

<h2>Structural Repair For Sagging Crawl Spaces</h2>
<a class="lightbox mag right border" title="Typical crawl space jack posts can rust, making them difficult or impossible to adjust.  The SmartJack&reg; system is made with galvanized steel to resist corrosion, and are installed with a 25-year written warranty." href="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/crawl-space-supports-lg.jpg"><img src="/core/images/about-us/crawl-space-contractor/crawl-space-supports-thm.jpg" alt="corrosion resistant crawl space support jacks made from galvanized steel" width="250px" height="250px;" /></a>
<p>Crawl spaces can experience structural damage for many reasons, the main reasons being the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your crawl space has too few structural supports.</li>
<li>The structural supports are sinking into the soil.</li>
<li>The structural wood in the crawl space is rotting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Structural damage in a crawl space can manifest itself in the home in many ways, including uneven floors, jamming doors, and cracks in the drywall.</p>
<p>Common solutions for crawl space structural repair are often ineffective -- and can even lead to further structural damage as they're installed.</p>
<p>Our award-winning SmartJack&reg; Crawl Space Support System provides a permanent, warrantied solution!</p>
